# NotifBypass

A lightweight, single-purpose Android utility that intercepts notifications from
**WhatsApp**, **Instagram**, and **TikTok**, and fires a unique custom vibration
(and optional sound) **only** when the notification is from a specific person —
even while the phone is in **Silent** or **Do Not Disturb**.

Target device: **Honor 70 / MagicOS (Android 12–13+)**. `minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 34`.

## Opening / building

This scaffold contains every **text** file. Three things are **binary** and were
intentionally NOT generated — let Android Studio create them on first open:

1. **`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`** — Android Studio regenerates the wrapper
   automatically (or run `gradle wrapper` if you have a system Gradle). The matching
   `gradle-wrapper.properties` is already provided.
2. **`local.properties`** — created automatically; it stores your machine's
   `sdk.dir` path. (Git-ignored.)
3. **`res/raw/emergency_tone.mp3`** — optional. Only needed if you enable
   `playEmergencySound()`. See `res/raw/README_PLACEHOLDER.txt`.

Steps:
1. **Android Studio → Open** → select this folder.
2. Let it sync Gradle (it will fetch the wrapper + dependencies).
3. Plug in the Honor 70 (USB debugging on) → **Run**.

> No `gradlew` scripts are committed because they are useless without the binary
> `gradle-wrapper.jar`; Android Studio recreates the full wrapper on import.

## Customizing

**Names are edited in-app** — open NotifBypass → *Who to alert* → one field per app
holds a comma-separated list of names/handles (case-insensitive `contains`). The
same person often shows up differently per app, e.g. `İlahə` on WhatsApp but
`ilo, @ilheexs` on TikTok. Matching is **per-app**, so a short alias can't
false-trigger in another app. Leave a field blank to disable that app. Values are
saved to `SharedPreferences` and read live by the listener — no rebuild needed.

In `MatchConfig.kt`:
- `APPS` → add/remove watched apps, change their labels, or change the built-in
  default aliases (used to prefill the fields on first launch).

**Vibration patterns are picked in-app** — open NotifBypass → *Vibration patterns* →
choose a rhythm for *Her texts* and *Her calls* from the dropdowns, and hit **Test**
to feel each one. Texts play once; calls loop until the call ends. Selections are
saved to `SharedPreferences` and read live by the listener.

To add/edit the available rhythms, see `VibrationPatterns.kt` (`TEXT` / `CALL`
lists — first entry is the default). Text patterns must be even-length (so they tile
cleanly when repeated in quiet mode); call patterns can be any length.

In `MyNotificationListener.kt`:
- Call vs text is detected via `Notification.CATEGORY_CALL`.
- `AMP_GENTLE` / `AMP_FULL` / `TEXT_REPEATS_QUIET` → mode-awareness. In **Silent/DND**
  the text buzz goes full-strength and repeats `TEXT_REPEATS_QUIET` times; in **Normal**
  it's a single gentle tap. Quiet mode = DND on, or ringer not normal (see `isQuietMode()`).
- `CALL_MAX_RING_MS` → safety cap on the looping call ring.

Shared playback (used by both the listener and the Test buttons) lives in `Haptics.kt`.

## Manual on-device setup (required)

The listener permission cannot be auto-granted, and MagicOS aggressively kills
background apps. After installing:

**Required**
1. **Notification Access** — open the app → *Grant Notification Access* → enable
   **NotifBypass**. Without this, nothing fires. Once active, the status shows a
   green tick (“Listener is active”) and the grant button hides itself; it
   reappears automatically if access is later revoked.

**Recommended for MagicOS persistence**
2. **Disable Battery Optimization** — app button → set NotifBypass to *Don't optimize*.
3. **Lock app in Recents** — open Recents, long-press the NotifBypass card → lock icon.
4. **App launch** — *Settings → Apps → NotifBypass → Launch*: turn off "Manage
   automatically"; enable Auto-launch, Secondary launch, Run in background.
5. **Startup apps** — *Phone Manager → Startup apps*: allow NotifBypass.

**DND / Silent**
6. The `USAGE_NOTIFICATION_RINGTONE` haptic is exempt from most suppression. If a
   MagicOS build still blocks it, enable `playEmergencySound()` (routes through the
   ALARM stream, which is almost always exempt).

## CI/CD — automatic APK builds & GitHub Releases

Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**What it does**
- Triggers on every push to `main`/`master`, on `v*` tags, and manually
  (*Actions → Build & Release APK → Run workflow*).
- Builds a release APK with Gradle (JDK 17, Android SDK, Gradle 8.7).
- Uploads the APK as a workflow **artifact** and publishes it to **GitHub Releases**.
  - **Tag push** (e.g. `git tag v1.1.0 && git push --tags`) → a normal release named after the tag.
  - **Branch push** → a rolling **pre-release** tagged `ci-<run-number>`.

**Signing — two modes (zero config works out of the box):**

| Mode | When | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| Debug-signed | No secrets set | APK installs fine for personal sideloading |
| Release-signed | Keystore secrets set | Properly signed release APK |

To enable real release signing, generate a keystore once:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore \
  -alias notifbypass -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Base64-encode it for the GitHub secret:
base64 -w0 release.keystore   # (macOS: base64 -i release.keystore)
```

Then add these in **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | the base64 string from above |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `notifbypass` (or your alias) |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | key password |

The workflow auto-detects the secrets: if present it signs with your keystore,
otherwise it falls back to the debug key. **Keep `release.keystore` private — do
not commit it.**

> Note: CI runs Gradle directly (`gradle assembleRelease`) rather than `./gradlew`,
> since the binary `gradle-wrapper.jar` isn't committed.

## Caveats (honest)

- **Silent/DND bypass uses ALARM-class haptics.** Vibrations are tagged
  `USAGE_ALARM` (see `Haptics.kt`), which is exempt from both Silent and DND on
  virtually all builds. (Ringtone/notification-class vibrations are tied to the
  ringer and get silenced in full Silent mode — that was the earlier bug.) Still
  best-effort: OEM skins can add their own suppression, and the ALARM-stream sound
  path remains the most bulletproof fallback.
- **Background survival is the real fragility point**, not the code — the
  lock-in-recents + battery-optimization-off steps matter most.
- **Call ring relies on the call notification.** The continuous ring vibration
  loops while the WhatsApp/IG/TikTok call notification is present and stops when it's
  removed. Most builds post a `CATEGORY_CALL` notification with the caller's name, so
  matching + detection work — but if a build doesn't, the call falls back to the
  one-shot text buzz. A missed-call notice afterward will also buzz as a text.
